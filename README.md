# Unity-FPS-Controller

This is a lightweight replacement to the FPS Controller Unity Provides

The Standard FPS Controller Unity Provides has a few problems: 

1. Custom Collision detection
2. Includes a bunch of script you dont need
3. Adds mobile touch support

Multiple Input Support:

Some people have asked how to use this for FPS Co-op games with controllers. Just replace the Input Names to what you created in your input settings. Youtube 'Unity FPS xbox controller' and you can see how its suppose to be setup in the Input settings. 

Note: Some people have input lag due to the Gravity for Horizontal and Vertical setting in your input settings. Turn that thing up to a high number and it will get better.
